# game
There is a button that you can press every day to receive a point. Compete with your friends to see who can get the most points.

In the first iteration of this game I wanted to throw together some fun program in one night. Then, some people actually started playing it. The old code was super unstable and difficult to change because it was thrown together, and I wanted to learn Rust, so I decided to rewrite it.
