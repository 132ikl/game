Chameleon Vision is free open-source software for FRC teams to use for vision proccesing on their robots.


There instructions are for compiling (contributing) and running the source-code of the project.
This is NOT intended for the co-processor setup or your testing PC. 
To run the program normally (from a build .jar file), take a look at our ReadTheDocs documentation for installation [here](https://chameleon-vision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/coprocessor-setup.html)


These instruction are for the Chameleon Vision's backend/server in Java

To run the UI's sourcecode (optional) see the UI's [readme](https://github.com/Chameleon-Vision/chameleon-vision/blob/master/chameleon-client/README.md)

## Hardware
Currently any 64-Bit devices (Windows, Linux and Mac OS) are supported.
